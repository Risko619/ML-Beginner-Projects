Linear Regression Model and Data Visualization
This code demonstrates how to build a linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn library and visualize the data using Matplotlib. 
The model is trained on student data to predict the final grade ('G3') based on previous grades ('G1' and 'G2') and the number of absences.

Getting Started
Make sure to have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage
Run the script using a Python interpreter:

python your_script_name.py
The script loads the student dataset, selects relevant features, and splits the data into training and testing sets.

It then trains a linear regression model and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.

The model with the highest accuracy is saved as 'studentmodel.pickle' for future use.

Scatter plots are generated to visualize the relationship between a selected feature and the final grade. Change the feature by modifying the 'p' variable.

Additional Information
The code uses Matplotlib to create scatter plots, allowing you to visually explore the relationship between different features and the final grade.

Make sure to adjust the 'p' variable to visualize different features on the scatter plot.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed using the provided installation command.
