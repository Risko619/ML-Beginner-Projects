# Breast Cancer Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying breast cancer data. The code specifically addresses situations where k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) yields low accuracy on high-dimensional data without linear correspondence.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
```
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter:

   ```
   python svm_breast_cancer.py
   ```

## Code Explanation

1. **Loading the Dataset:**

   The code uses the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn, loading features (`x`) and labels (`y`).

   ```python
   cancer = load_breast_cancer()
   x = cancer.data
   y = cancer.target
   ```

2. **Train-Test Split:**

   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

   ```python
   x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2)
   ```

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation:**

   A linear SVM classifier (`SVC`) is created and trained on the training data.

   ```python
   clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
   clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Prediction and Accuracy Calculation:**

   The trained SVM model predicts labels for the test set, and accuracy is calculated using scikit-learn's `accuracy_score` function.

   ```python
   y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)
   acc = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print("Accuracy:", acc)
   ```

## Summary

In summary, this script serves as a demonstration of using SVM for breast cancer classification. 
It leverages scikit-learn functionalities to load the dataset, split it for training and testing, train an SVM classifier,
make predictions, and assess the accuracy of the model. 
The primary aim is to evaluate SVM's performance on breast cancer classification tasks, especially in scenarios where KNN may not perform optimally.
